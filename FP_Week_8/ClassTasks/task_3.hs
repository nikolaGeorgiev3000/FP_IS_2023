{-
Define a new data type called Shape. Shape must have four constructors:

Circle: with one argument representing the radius;
Rectangle: with two arguments representing the width and height;
Triangle;
Cylinder with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.
Create a shape from every type and output it.
